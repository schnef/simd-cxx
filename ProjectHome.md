SimD (**Sim\*ple**D\*DS) is a C++ API intended to greatly simplify the use of DDS. As such, SimD uses templates and some little template meta-programming to provide an API that reduces by several times the line of code that need to be written for a DDS application. With SIMD you can write a DDS application in 4 lines of code!

An intro presentation on SimD is available at http://bit.ly/cEE5km
